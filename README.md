# Hello, my name is:

Grigory Shipunov

- People call me Grisha.
- On interwebs I usually go by oxapentane.
- If you want to grab me AFK, maximum probability of doing so is in North Holland.
- I'm fluent in Russian and English.
- I'm more than quarter of a century old.
- As you might have noticed, I like bulleted lists[^0].

[^0]: And footnotes!

## What I'm up to

- Working at [Universiteit van Amsterdam](https://iop.uva.nl), where I manage labs of [Quantum Matter group](https://iop.uva.nl/research/research-programs/quantum-materials/quantum-materials.html) and maintain big science machines, with a spot of teaching.
- One can say I'm a big fan of [listening to German public transport](https://github.com/tlm-solutions)[^funk].
- Fucking around with Nix and Rust.
- From time to time enthusiastically shaving yaks.
- Also, I did some [mother nature reverse engineering](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Kg8kRBcAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao)[^1].

[^1]: Sometimes boringly called "science".
[^funk]: I guess that corresponds to favourite music genre of "Vehrker-Elektrofunk".
